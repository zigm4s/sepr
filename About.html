        <h4>General information</h4>
                <p>
                The island Piirissaare (Engl. translation Border Island) is located in Eastern Estonia in Tartu county in Lake Peipsi, which is the fourth largest freshwater lake in Europe. Piirissaare forms an independent parish and has a local government and local municipality. Being close to the border of the Russian Federation, thus to the border of the European Union, Piirissaare has a border service on the island. Piirissaare is approximately 270 km from Tallinn and 80 km from Tartu.<br><br>
                Piirissaare area is 7.8 km2. There are three villages on the island – Piiri, Saare and Tooni. The island is plain and most of the land is covered by marshes. Only 55 hectares in the northeast part of the island are built out or used for growing vegetables, mainly onions.<br><br>
                Although there are 101 registered habitants (by January 1, 2005), the actual number of people living on the island throughout the year is 65. During summertime the number increases up to 300 since many people spend the summer at their relatives’. <br><br>
                Piirissaare is very different from rest of Estonia because of its archaic, ethnic and cultural composition. Most of the habitants are Old Believers who first settled on the island in the 18th century to find a peaceful place beyond the reach of the reforms under the Russian Orthodox Church. First written documents from the Old Believers church on Piirissaare date back to 1802. Old Believers have been living in a separate community on the island in small settlements, forging a living from fishing and vegetable growing. Preserving this interesting and unique culture is considered an important objective for the area.
